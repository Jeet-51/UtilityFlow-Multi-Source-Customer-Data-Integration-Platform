## üìñ Overview

UtilityFlow is an enterprise-grade data integration and analytics platform built to consolidate customer information from numerous sources into a single, unified view. This project addresses the critical need for a centralized data warehouse to improve data quality, enable comprehensive analytics, and provide actionable insights for a modern utility provider. By integrating customer billing, usage, and service data, UtilityFlow empowers executives to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## üéØ The Problem

Prior to UtilityFlow, critical customer data was fragmented across **six disparate and siloed systems**. This created significant operational challenges:

* **Data Inconsistency:** A lack of a single source of truth led to conflicting and unreliable data across departments.
* **Poor Data Quality:** Manual processes and a lack of validation resulted in rampant inaccuracies, impacting reporting and customer service.
* **Inefficient Analytics:** Generating even basic reports was a time-consuming, manual effort, preventing timely analysis and strategic planning.
* **Inability to Gain a 360¬∞ Customer View:** It was impossible to track the complete customer journey, from billing and usage to service interactions.

---

## üí° The Solution

To overcome these challenges, we architected and implemented UtilityFlow, a robust, cloud-native data platform on **Microsoft Azure**. The platform automates the entire data lifecycle‚Äîfrom ingestion and transformation to visualization‚Äîensuring that high-quality, analysis-ready information is always available to stakeholders.

### Key Features

* **Automated ETL/ELT Pipelines:** Architected enterprise-scale pipelines using **Azure Data Factory** and **SSIS** to seamlessly ingest data from all six source systems.
* **Advanced Data Cleansing:** Implemented robust data validation, standardization, and cleansing processes to handle over **2 million customer records** monthly.
* **Optimized Data Warehousing:** Built and deployed dimensional data models in **Azure Synapse Analytics** following the **Kimball methodology** to support high-performance analytics and reporting.
* **Actionable Executive Dashboards:** Delivered a suite of **Power BI** dashboards and reports, enabling executives to track customer satisfaction metrics, service reliability KPIs, and other critical business drivers in near real-time.
* **Modern Data Transformation:** Leveraged **Python** and **dbt** for complex, version-controlled, and testable data transformations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Technologies Used

The UtilityFlow platform is built on a modern data stack, leveraging the power and scalability of Microsoft Azure.

* **Data Integration & Orchestration:**
    * **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** The primary tool for orchestrating cloud-based ETL and ELT workflows.
    * **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS):** Used for complex on-premises data integration tasks and legacy system connectivity.

* **Data Warehousing & Analytics Engine:**
    * **Azure Synapse Analytics:** The core of our platform, providing a limitless analytics service that brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics.
    * **SQL Server:** Used for staging and intermediate data storage.

* **Data Transformation:**
    * **Python:** Employed for custom data cleansing scripts and complex business logic implementation within Azure Functions and Databricks.
    * **dbt (data build tool):** Utilized for transforming data within Synapse Analytics, applying software engineering best practices to analytics code.

* **Data Visualization & Reporting:**
    * **Power BI:** The visualization layer, used to build interactive dashboards and reports for business users and executives.
